Google Drive Photo Gallery

A small experiment born out of necessity for a family reunion.

Objectives: 
- Create a slideshow of a central location of family photos, each with a caption.
- To avoid having to manage all of the photos myself, any family member can upload a picture and type a caption using a Google Form
- The responses of the Google Form (image path and caption) are kept in a CSV
- The information from the CSV is loaded into a dynamic gallery on a webpage
